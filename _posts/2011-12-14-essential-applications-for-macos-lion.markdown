After obtaining a machine with MacOS Lion in it, here are the applications that look absolutely mandatory.
This list is more a memo than anything, but you could find it useful.

  * [ClamXav](http://www.clamxav.com/), a free open-source antivirus. This can be downloaded from the AppleStore. Scans are light and quick.
  * [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/), great free ressource for documentation, and has no Oracle logo included with it. 
  * Xcode, a free development kit for Mac applications. It includes a gcc compiler, and can be found in the AppleStore.
  * iterm(2), alternative for terminal knowing that the default terminal in MacOS is a pain to use. [iterm](http://iterm.sourceforge.net/) is not fully compatible with MacOSX Lion but [iterm2](http://www.iterm2.com) can be a solution.
  * [vlc](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ ), a video viewer ressource. I'm with it for a couple of years, and it has always been astonishing light and fast.
  * [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org), an alternative way to manage packages with command line.
  * Minecraft, no comments on this one...

And that's all...
