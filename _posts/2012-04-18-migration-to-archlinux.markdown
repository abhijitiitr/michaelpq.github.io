In one word, [Archlinux](http://www.archlinux.org/) is AWESOME. It
is the first distribution of Linux that I use giving me the feeling
that I control everything in my environment. Among its strengths,
its package manager pacman makes everything very flexible and once
you migrate to it, you don't need to worry about support time or
anything like for Ubuntu distributions or most of the major distributions.

However setting up an Arch environment is honestly a pain for noobs.
So, based on my *painful* experience, I created some manuals that can be
used to install an ArchLinux environment using XFCE as Desktop. So here
is the list of manuals.

  * [Installation of XFCE in VirtualBox or nvidia driver
  * [Commands for pacman](/manuals/archlinux/pacman/), package manager
  of ArchLinux
  * [Manual for yaourt](/manuals/archlinux/yaourt/), installation and
  commands for this powerful package manager
  * [Proxy settings](/manuals/archlinux/proxy-settings/), when ArchLinux
  is behind a Proxy
  * [Useful packages](/manuals/archlinux/useful-packages/)

Those manuals are not perfect, but give good guidelines of my migration
experience. Enjoy!
