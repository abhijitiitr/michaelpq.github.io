Last month was my last month working for NTT. I spent there 4 years working with wonderful people who taught me a lot, and not only about engineering :). During this time, I have been focused mainly on the development and support of Postgres-XC, a fork of PostgreSQL providing parallel query execution and multi-master features, and also PostgreSQL.

This does not mean that I am leaving those communities. On the contrary, as from today I am joining VMWare, I will continue to work on cool stuff related to PostgreSQL.

So thank you NTT people for all the good time I had, and also thank you VMWare for all the fun I am going to have.

See you soon on the community mailing lists!
