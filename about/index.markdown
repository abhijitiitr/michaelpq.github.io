This [blog](/) is maintained by Michael Paquier, currently living in Japan,
acting as a contributor of the [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org/) and
involved in its community for a couple of years now. Main areas of focus
are replication with for example technologies of the type multi-master
(as a committer of [Postgres-XC](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/postgres-xc/index.php?title=Main_Page),
concurrent DDLs, parallel query processing, and many other things like
as well HA and recovery/backup.

There are many ways to get in touch, two of them at least being on this
page!
