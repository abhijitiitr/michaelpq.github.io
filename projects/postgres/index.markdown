[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) is the world's most advanced open source database. It offers many features and is used in many production systems worldwide so feel free to have a look at [its documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/) and get a grasp of what it can do and with its active community it can actually do a lot.

As a community member, on top of maintaining this blog, here are the things I try to keep up with:

  * Patch submission and review
  * Involvement in hackers discussion, with sometimes participation in some other mailing lists
  * Participation in conferences, involvement in Japanese community
  * Sometimes on IRC...
  * Test machine maintenance in [Postgres buildfarm](http://buildfarm.postgresql.org/)
  * Committer of [Postgres-XC](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/postgres-xc/index.php?title=Main_Page), fork of Postgres providing some multi-master capabilities using data replication and sharding.
  * Some development activities
   * [Dev postgres](https://github.com/michaelpq/postgres), a mirror of vanilla with only master branch and a set of patches in development
   * [pg_arman](https://github.com/michaelpq/pg_arman), backup and recovery manager
   * [pg_workers](https://github.com/michaelpq/pg_workers), some background workers that can be used as a base for more complex implementations
